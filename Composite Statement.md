# Composite Statements in Discrete Mathematics

In discrete mathematics, a **composite statement** is a logical statement that is formed by combining two or more simpler statements using logical operators. These operators include:

- **Conjunction (And):** The composite statement "A and B" is true only when both A and B are true.

- **Disjunction (Or):** The composite statement "A or B" is true when at least one of A or B is true.

- **Negation (Not):** The composite statement "not A" is true when A is false, and vice versa.

- **Implication (If... then...):** The composite statement "If A, then B" (A → B) is false only when A is true and B is false; otherwise, it's true.

- **Biconditional (If and only if):** The composite statement "A if and only if B" (A ↔ B) is true when A and B have the same truth value; both are either true or false.

Understanding composite statements is crucial in logic and mathematics, as they are foundational for reasoning, proofs, and problem-solving. By manipulating and analyzing these composite statements, you can derive new statements, deduce logical consequences, and establish relationships between various ideas or propositions.
