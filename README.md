The implication "False implies True" is considered to be true in classical logic. This might seem counterintuitive at first, but in classical logic, an implication is considered false only when the antecedent (the "if" part) is true and the consequent (the "then" part) is false. In this case, since the antecedent "False" is false, the implication is not violated, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.

Here's the truth table for implication (â†’):

| Antecedent | Consequent | Implication |
|------------|------------|-------------|
|   False    |   False    |    True     |
|   False    |   True     |    True     |
|   True     |   False    |    False    |
|   True     |   True     |    True     |

As you can see, the "False implies True" row has an implication value of True. This might feel counterintuitive, but it's a characteristic of classical logic.
